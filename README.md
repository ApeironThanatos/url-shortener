# URL SHORTENER
It is a small set of PHP scripts that will help you in shortening your url by which you can get a more precised version of your url at ease.

**Basic UI :**
![url-shortener](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urls/url-shortener/master/img/imgone.jpg)

```
Enter the domain in the input box. In order to find whether a url is valid or invalid there are two check avilable.
one is the inbuilt check of HTML5 (type="email") this by default checks the validity of url and the other is the manual check using php (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL).
```

![url-shortener](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urls/url-shortener/master/img/imagethree.jpg)

**If all the things worked correctly, then you will get output something like this :**
